## :dart: About ##

Simple React application that fetches mock data from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
I kept the application quite rudimentary

### Observations
- React Context.
  - For the Authentication I have gone with a simple implementation that requires no route checking. If I were to implement this, I think having/creating a custom Auth context to keep track of the login/out states would be much beneficial
- Caching.
  - This app could benefit from further improvements to data fetching. At the moment, I implemented pagination to prevent slow loading due to the amount of items(5000) its was fetching and trying to display at once. This solves the issue in our case but if we needed to scale, a cache would come in handy.
